# OpenAutoLink

[![CI](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

OpenAutoLink is an open-source wireless Android Auto bridge for AAOS head units. An SBC handles the phone's Android Auto session over WiFi, then streams video, audio, and control data to an app on the car's display over Ethernet. The goal is to restore a native-feeling Android Auto experience on vehicles that ship with AAOS but without built-in Android Auto support.

## Why This Exists

Starting with the 2024 model year, GM dropped Apple CarPlay and Android Auto from its electric vehicles in favor of Google built-in infotainment. OpenAutoLink exists to bring Android Auto back by bridging a phone's Android Auto session to the car's AAOS head unit over the network, without relying on proprietary USB adapter hardware.

The current design is purpose-built for this setup:

- The phone connects wirelessly to the SBC over Bluetooth and WiFi.
- The SBC runs the Android Auto session and relays it over TCP.
- The AAOS app renders video and audio, forwards touch and car data, and manages reconnection.

## What It Does

- Wireless Android Auto over Bluetooth + WiFi, no phone cable required
- **EV battery and energy data in Android Auto** — battery percentage, range, fuel type, and charge port forwarded from the car's VHAL into Android Auto, where Google Maps displays it natively alongside navigation. No other aftermarket bridge or OEM wireless Android Auto implementation does this
- Up to 1080p60 by default, with 1440p and 4K available through AA Developer Mode and supported codecs
- Automatic display adaptation for wide and irregular AAOS displays
- Audio forwarding for media, navigation, phone calls, and voice assistant
- Touch input, steering wheel controls, and microphone forwarding
- Instrument-cluster integration for turn-by-turn and media metadata
- Multi-phone pairing and one-tap switching
- Automatic reconnect after car sleep / power loss
- Bridge auto-update from GitHub Releases
- Fully open-source app, bridge, protocol, and deployment scripts

## How It Works

An SBC bridges the phone's Android Auto session to the car over WiFi + Ethernet. The car runs the OpenAutoLink app and the SBC runs the bridge. [DietPi](https://dietpi.com/) is the recommended OS — it is lightweight, boots quickly from eMMC, and supports a wide range of ARM64 boards out of the box.

```
Android Phone ──WiFi TCP:5277──▶                    ┌── Control :5288 (JSON lines)
                  BT pairing    ▶ SBC Bridge ──Eth──▶├── Video   :5290 (binary frames)
                                                    └── Audio   :5289 (binary frames)
                                                          ▼
                                                  Car Head Unit App (AAOS)
                                                    Renders video/audio
                                                    Forwards touch/GNSS/VHAL
```

The short version is simple: the phone talks Android Auto to the SBC, and the SBC talks OpenAutoLink's TCP protocol to the AAOS app.

## Why Not a USB Adapter?

The CPC200-CCPA and similar USB adapters proved that Android Auto on AAOS was possible, but they are closed-source dongles with fixed assumptions about resolution, capabilities, and car integration. OpenAutoLink replaces that model with a software-defined bridge that can adapt to the vehicle and evolve over time.

| | CPC200 / USB Adapter | OpenAutoLink (SBC Bridge) |
|---|---|---|
| **USB permission prompt** | Every startup on some GM vehicles | Never, because the car sees a network device instead of a USB accessory session |
| **Resolution** | Usually fixed at 800×480 or sometimes 720p | Up to 1080p60 by default, with 1440p and 4K available through AA Developer Mode and supported codecs |
| **Codec** | H.264 only | H.264, H.265, and VP9 protocol support, with auto-negotiation |
| **Display adaptation** | Fixed output, often stretched or letterboxed | Reads AAOS display dimensions and cutout insets to compute safe areas and aspect handling |
| **Vehicle data to AA** | None or minimal | Full forwarding pipeline from VHAL and sensors; AA and Maps appear to use only a small subset today, but the broader data path is already there for future support |
| **EV support** | None | Sends EV-related data such as battery percentage, range, fuel type, and connector type |
| **Navigation cluster** | Not available | Turn-by-turn on the instrument cluster |
| **Media cluster** | Not available | Album art and track info on cluster-capable vehicles |
| **Multi-phone** | Not available | Pair multiple phones, choose a default, switch in app |
| **Microphone** | Typically phone-side only | Car mic or phone mic, configurable |
| **Steering wheel buttons** | Limited | Media and voice-related forwarding where AAOS allows it |
| **Updates** | Replace or reflash hardware | Bridge updates via GitHub Releases, app updates via Play Console |
| **Wide display / ultra-wide** | Usually poor | Native adaptation for very wide AAOS displays |
| **Customization** | None | Insets, display mode, video scaling, DPI, and related settings |
| **Source code** | Closed | Fully open-source |
| **Cost** | Adapter hardware | Commodity SBC + USB Ethernet adapter |

## Video, Resolution, and Display Behavior

### Video Modes

By default, OpenAutoLink uses auto-negotiation. The bridge offers supported codec and resolution tiers in the Android Auto service discovery response, and the phone picks the best combination it supports.

| Resolution | Codec | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 480p (800×480) | H.264 | Always available |
| 720p (1280×720) | H.264 | Always available |
| 1080p (1920×1080) | H.264, H.265, VP9 | Main tier |
| 1440p (2560×1440) | H.265, VP9 | Requires AA Developer Mode on the phone |
| 4K (3840×2160) | H.265, VP9 | Requires AA Developer Mode on the phone |

H.264 generally tops out at 1080p for practical phone encoder support. H.265 and VP9 are the paths to 1440p and 4K.

</p>

### Enabling Higher Resolutions

1. On the phone, enable [Android Auto Developer Mode](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/testing#developer-mode).
2. Open Android Auto settings, tap the version entry 10 times, then open Developer settings.
3. Set Video resolution to the highest available tier.
4. In the OpenAutoLink app, go to Settings → Video.
5. Leave Auto enabled to let the phone pick the best supported mode, or manually choose a codec and resolution.

> **Blazer EV note:** On a 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV, 1440p at 230 DPI is a great combination — text and UI elements are sharp and well-proportioned for the wide display.

### Display Adaptation

OpenAutoLink is designed for AAOS displays that are not simple 16:9 rectangles. The "pixel aspect" is auto-calcualted so that the AA 16:9 video stream is perfectly displayed even on ultra-wide screens. The app includes a content inset editor that lets you push Android Auto's UI inward from any edge of the screen, so buttons and controls stay away from curved bezels or clipped areas. I reccomend pulling the top down about 50-55 pixels for the Blazer EV screen.

## What You Need

### Hardware

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Single-board computer (SBC)** | ARM64 with onboard Ethernet, 5 GHz WiFi, and Bluetooth 4.0+ |
| **USB Ethernet adapter** | USB-C strongly recommended so it plugs directly into the car |
| **Short Ethernet cable** | Connects the SBC's onboard Ethernet to the USB adapter |
| **Power for the SBC** | USB-C power supply or in-car USB-C power source |
| **Storage** | eMMC preferred for faster boot; microSD works but is slower |

### Choosing an SBC

The bridge relays already-encoded video and audio, so raw CPU performance matters less than boot time, WiFi quality, and reliable networking.

| Priority | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Onboard Ethernet NIC** | Required for the car-side network link |
| **5 GHz WiFi (onboard)** | Required for stable wireless Android Auto streaming |
| **Bluetooth 4.0+** | Required for pairing and WiFi credential exchange |
| **eMMC storage** | Faster and more reliable than microSD; meaningfully reduces boot time |
| **CPU / RAM** | Mostly affects boot time; modest ARM64 hardware is enough |
| **Size** | Smaller is easier to hide in the console |

**Recommended OS: [DietPi](https://dietpi.com/) or [Armbian Minimal](https://www.armbian.com/)** — both are lightweight Debian-based distributions that boot quickly and support a wide range of ARM64 boards. Use the headless/minimal server image.

#### Development / tested boards

The primary development board is a **Khadas VIM4** (Amlogic A311D2, 8 GB RAM, 32 GB eMMC, Wi-Fi 6, GigE). The **Raspberry Pi 5** is also tested and works well. Both are overkill for this workload — the bridge does not benefit from their CPU headroom — but they are convenient for development.

The current daily-driver board is an **Orange Pi Zero2** (Allwinner H616, 1 GB RAM, Wi-Fi 5, GigE) running Armbian Minimal. It boots and connects in about 30–40 seconds and is compact enough to hide easily in the center console.

#### Recommended boards (DietPi, all criteria met)

These boards hit the right balance of cost, boot speed, and wireless performance — all have onboard GigE, onboard 5 GHz WiFi + Bluetooth, and eMMC:

| Board | Approx. Price | SoC | RAM | WiFi | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Orange Pi 5B** | ~$65–$80 | RK3588S | 8 GB | Wi-Fi 6 (onboard) | Best value sweet spot; 16–128 GB eMMC onboard |
| **Radxa ROCK 5B** | ~$90–$130 | RK3588 | 4–16 GB | Wi-Fi 6E (M.2 module) | Dual 2.5 GbE; eMMC slot |
| **Orange Pi 3B** | ~$35–$45 | RK3566 | 1–8 GB | Wi-Fi 5 (onboard) | Good lower-cost option; eMMC slot |

#### Validated budget board

| Board | Approx. Price | SoC | RAM | WiFi | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Orange Pi Zero2** | ~$20–$30 | Allwinner H616 | 1 GB | Wi-Fi 5 (onboard) | Currently in daily use with Armbian Minimal; compact, boots fast, very affordable |

#### Other budget boards (pending validation)

These meet the spec on paper and are cheap enough to be worth trying:

| Board | Approx. Price | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Orange Pi Zero 3** | ~$20–$30 | Allwinner H618; onboard GigE + Wi-Fi 5 + BT 5.0; up to 4 GB RAM; compact |
| **Radxa ROCK 3A / 3C** | ~$35–$50 | RK3566; eMMC slot; onboard WiFi on some variants |

### Physical Connection

```
┌─────────────┐    Ethernet     ┌─────────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
│     SBC     │───── cable ────▶│  USB Ethernet   │──USB-C─▶│  Car USB     │
│  (bridge)   │                 │    adapter      │         │    port      │

│  Power ◀────── USB-C from 12V adapter or spare USB port
└─────────────┘
```

1. Connect the SBC's onboard Ethernet port to the USB Ethernet adapter.
2. Plug the USB Ethernet adapter into the car's USB port.
3. Power the SBC from a 12 V USB-C adapter or a spare USB power source.
4. Pair the phone over Bluetooth and let it join the SBC's 5 GHz WiFi AP.

Blazer EV note: the USB-C port inside the center console armrest compartment is the one known to enumerate USB network devices to the head unit.

### Placement

The SBC, adapter, and cable can usually live entirely inside the center console compartment. If the SBC needs more airflow, use a slightly longer Ethernet cable and move it to a better-ventilated spot while keeping the USB NIC on the working car port.

## Quick Start

> There is no public Play Store listing today. Each user must publish the AAOS app through their own Google Play Console account.

### Bridge Setup

No local build is required. The SBC install script downloads the latest prebuilt bridge binary from GitHub Releases.

1. Flash [DietPi](https://dietpi.com/) or Armbian Minimal (or any ARM64 Linux server image) onto your SBC.
2. Connect the SBC's onboard Ethernet to your router or laptop to get a DHCP address.
3. SSH in and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mossyhub/openautolink/main/bridge/sbc/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The installer downloads packages, deploys the bridge, and applies the network configuration. When it finishes, it prints a summary showing that the onboard Ethernet is now a static car connection and the WiFi radio is a phone hotspot — **the SBC no longer has internet or general SSH access through those adapters.**

After a reboot, all services start automatically and the bridge is ready for the car. If you need further ssh access, you can use the in-app "Bridge" settings to set a static Wifi password (in normal operation the Wifi password is randomly geenrated), then connect your laptop to it.

### App Setup

Because this is an AAOS app rather than a normal phone app, installation on the car goes through your own Google Play Console account and an AAOS release track.

1. Create a [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/) developer account.
2. Create a new app and configure an AAOS release track.
3. Change the package name in `app/build.gradle.kts` from `com.openautolink.app` to your own unique ID.
4. Generate an upload keystore:

   ```powershell
   .\scripts\create-upload-keystore.ps1
   ```

5. Build and sign the release AAB:

   ```powershell
   .\scripts\bundle-release.ps1
   ```

6. Add testers to the AAOS track in Play Console.
7. Upload the AAB and publish the release.
8. Accept the tester opt-in invitation for each Google account used on the car.
9. Install the app from the Play Store on the head unit.
10. Manually grant the **Car Information** permission in Settings → Apps → OpenAutoLink → Permissions.

## Known Issues

- **Steering wheel controls on GM EVs:** the left-side rocker currently maps to skip forward and play/pause only. Previous-track is not exposed by GM. The steering-wheel voice button is consumed by the system before the app can intercept it.
- **Audio playback on first boot:** when pressing play on Spotify or other media apps, it will take a few taps to get it to play, but after that it will work as expected. This is still under investigation.
- **"Unsupported device" popup on GM EVs:** the USB Ethernet adapter can trigger a brief cosmetic warning even though networking still works.
- **The Android Auto stream green or black** UI may start out blocky and green or black, but will self recover in 10-20 seconds. Still fighting this one...

## Compatibility

OpenAutoLink is not yet known to work across all AAOS vehicles. It is currently validated on a 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV. Other GM vehicles on similar AAOS platforms may work, but that has not been verified broadly, and non-GM AAOS vehicles may impose different restrictions around USB networking or app access. Currently it is known that my GM vhicle automatically sets a USB NIC to a static 192.168.222.108 ip address, so this repo takes advatage of that. The app settings include UI to change the IP the bridge connects to if you see different behavior in your vehicle.

## Acknowledgments

OpenAutoLink is built from scratch, but it draws heavily on prior open-source Android Auto research and implementation work.

### Where It Started

- **[metheos/carlink_native](https://github.com/metheos/carlink_native)** / **[lvalen91/carlink_native](https://github.com/lvalen91/carlink_native)** and the **[XDA CarLink thread](https://xdaforums.com/t/carlink.4774308)** inspired the original proof of concept and helped demonstrate that AAOS-side Android Auto bridging was feasible.

### Core Dependency

- **[opencardev/aasdk](https://github.com/opencardev/aasdk)** by [Michal Szwaj (f1x)](https://github.com/nickel110) is the Android Auto protocol library underneath the bridge. OpenAutoLink maintains a [fork](https://github.com/mossyhub/aasdk) with NavigationStatus extensions.

### Projects I Learned From

- **[opencardev/openauto](https://github.com/opencardev/openauto)** for head unit emulator architecture and session patterns.
- **[Crankshaft](https://github.com/nickel110/crankshaft-ng)** for the embedded Android Auto distribution model and deployment ideas.
- **[nickel110/WirelessAndroidAutoDongle](https://github.com/nickel110/WirelessAndroidAutoDongle)** for Bluetooth pairing and WiFi credential exchange reference points.

### On AI Assistance

This project is heavily AI-assisted, but it is grounded in extensive real hardware testing. The code moves faster with Copilot; the driveway testing, log analysis, and protocol debugging are still what determine whether the result is actually good.

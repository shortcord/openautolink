# OpenAutoLink

> Wireless Android Auto for AAOS head units. No extra hardware.

[![CI](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Release](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/actions/workflows/release-apk.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/releases/latest)

OpenAutoLink runs the full Android Auto protocol stack natively on an AAOS head unit using the [aasdk](https://github.com/opencardev/aasdk) C++ library via JNI. No SBC, no USB adapter, no extra hardware — the car and phone talk directly over WiFi.

## Why This Exists

Starting with the 2024 model year, GM dropped Apple CarPlay and Android Auto from its electric vehicles in favor of Google built-in infotainment. OpenAutoLink brings Android Auto back — the car app runs the AA protocol directly, connecting to the phone over WiFi with no intermediate hardware.

## How It Works

OpenAutoLink embeds the [aasdk](https://github.com/opencardev/aasdk) v1.6 C++ library directly into the AAOS app via JNI. The native layer handles the full AA protocol pipeline — SSL handshake, encryption, message framing, and channel multiplexing — while the Kotlin layer manages transport, video rendering, audio playback, and UI.

Two connection methods:

**Wireless (Nearby Connections):** A companion app on the phone advertises via Google Nearby Connections. The car discovers the phone, upgrades to WiFi, and starts an AA session.

**USB (AOA v2):** Plug the phone directly into the head unit's USB port. The app performs the Android Open Accessory handshake and runs the AA session over bulk USB endpoints.

## What You Need

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **AAOS vehicle** | Tested on 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV. Other GM EVs likely work |
| **Android phone** | Running the OpenAutoLink Companion app |
| **Google Play Console account** | To publish the AAOS app to your car |

That's it. No SBC, no Ethernet adapter, no extra hardware.

### Phone Setup

Install the **OpenAutoLink Companion** app on your phone. It handles:
- Nearby Connections advertising (phone discovery)
- Android Auto Service auto-start detection
- Custom device name for multi-phone identification

You can either download a prebuilt APK from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/actions/workflows/build-companion.yml) (click the latest run → Artifacts → `companion-debug-apk`) or build it yourself from the `companion/` directory.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Companion App (Phone)

**Option A — Download prebuilt APK:**
1. Go to [Build Companion APK](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/actions/workflows/build-companion.yml) on GitHub Actions.
2. Click the latest successful run.
3. Download the `companion-debug-apk` artifact.
4. Unzip and install the APK on your phone (enable "Install from unknown sources" if prompted).

**Option B — Build from source:**
```powershell
cd companion
..\gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -r build/outputs/apk/debug/*.apk
```

The companion APK is signed with the Android debug key, which is fine for sideloading.

### 2. Build and Publish the Car App (AAOS)

Because this is an AAOS app, installation on the car goes through your own Google Play Console account:

1. Create a [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/) developer account.
2. Create a new app and configure an AAOS release track.
3. Change the package name in `app/build.gradle.kts` from `com.openautolink.app` to your own unique ID.
4. Generate an upload keystore:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\create-upload-keystore.ps1
   ```
5. Build and sign the release AAB:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\bundle-release.ps1
   ```
6. Upload the AAB to Play Console, publish, and install on the car via Play Store.
7. Grant the **Car Information** permission: Settings → Apps → OpenAutoLink → Permissions.

### 3. Connect

**Wireless:**
1. Open the Companion app on the phone and tap **Start**.
2. Open OpenAutoLink on the car — it discovers the phone automatically.
3. Android Auto projection starts within seconds.

**USB:**
1. Plug the phone into the head unit's USB port.
2. OpenAutoLink detects the device and performs the AOA v2 handshake.
3. Android Auto projection starts over the USB connection.

## Video and Display

### Native Dependencies

The C++ JNI layer links against prebuilt static libraries (OpenSSL, Boost, aasdk + protobuf + abseil). These are built once and cached:

- **CI builds** download them automatically from a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/releases/tag/native-deps).
- **Local builds** (WSL): run the build scripts once, then Gradle finds them:
  ```bash
  scripts/build-openssl-android.sh    # OpenSSL for ARM64
  scripts/setup-ndk-deps.sh           # Boost headers
  scripts/build-aasdk-android.sh      # aasdk + protobuf + abseil
  ```

### Resolution Tiers

| Resolution | Codec | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 480p (800×480) | H.264 | Always available |
| 720p (1280×720) | H.264 | Always available |
| 1080p (1920×1080) | H.264, H.265, VP9 | Default tier |
| 1440p (2560×1440) | H.265, VP9 | Requires AA Developer Mode |
| 4K (3840×2160) | H.265, VP9 | Requires AA Developer Mode |

By default, the app uses auto-negotiation — the phone picks the best codec and resolution it supports.

### Display Adaptation

OpenAutoLink auto-computes `width_margin` (or `height_margin` for portrait displays) to tell the phone to render a wider viewport matching the display's aspect ratio. This avoids stretched circles and distorted UI that `pixel_aspect_ratio_e4` cannot fix (Qualcomm decoders ignore `MediaCodec` scaling modes). A safe area editor lets you push UI inward from screen edges to avoid curved bezels.

> **Blazer EV tip:** 1440p at 230 DPI works well. Pull the top safe area inset down ~50px.

## Repository Layout

| Component | Language | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Car App** | Kotlin / Compose | `app/` | AAOS app — UI, video, audio, sensors |
| **C++ JNI Layer** | C++20 | `app/src/main/cpp/` | aasdk v1.6 AA protocol via JNI |
| **Companion App** | Kotlin / Compose | `companion/` | Phone-side Nearby Connections advertiser |
| **aasdk (submodule)** | C++ | `external/opencardev-aasdk/` | AA protocol library ([fork](https://github.com/mossyhub/aasdk)) |
| **Native build scripts** | Bash | `scripts/` | Cross-compile OpenSSL, Boost, aasdk for Android |
| **Documentation** | Markdown | `docs/` | Architecture, protocol, embedded knowledge |
| **Build/Deploy scripts** | PowerShell | `scripts/` | Release bundling, deployment, testing |

### C++ JNI Layer

The app embeds aasdk as a prebuilt static library (`.a`) and links it via CMake/NDK. The JNI bridge files handle the boundary between Kotlin and C++:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `aasdk_jni.cpp` | JNI entry point — native method registration |
| `jni_session.{h,cpp}` | aasdk pipeline: SSLWrapper → Cryptor → Messenger → channels |
| `jni_channel_handlers.{h,cpp}` | Per-channel handler classes (audio, sensor, input, nav, mic, media, phone, BT) |
| `jni_transport.{h,cpp}` | `ITransport` backed by Kotlin byte streams (Nearby or USB) |

### Historical

The original architecture used an SBC (single-board computer) running a C++ bridge binary and Python Bluetooth/WiFi scripts to relay Android Auto from the phone to the car over Ethernet. That was replaced by direct mode. The app initially reimplemented the AA protocol in Kotlin, which was then replaced by the current aasdk C++ JNI approach for protocol correctness and performance. The bridge code is preserved on the [`bridge-mode`](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/tree/bridge-mode) branch.

## Known Issues

No critical issues at this time. If you encounter problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/issues).

## Compatibility

Validated on a **2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV** running AAOS 12L. Other GM EVs on similar AAOS platforms likely work but have not been broadly tested. Non-GM AAOS vehicles may have different restrictions.

The companion app runs on any Android phone with Google Play Services (Nearby Connections requires it).

## Why This Exists

Starting with the 2024 model year, GM dropped Apple CarPlay and Android Auto from its electric vehicles in favor of Google built-in infotainment. OpenAutoLink brings Android Auto back — the car app runs the AA protocol directly, connecting to the phone over WiFi with no intermediate hardware.

## How It Works

OpenAutoLink embeds the [aasdk](https://github.com/opencardev/aasdk) v1.6 C++ library directly into the AAOS app via JNI. The native layer handles the full AA protocol pipeline — SSL handshake, encryption, message framing, and channel multiplexing — while the Kotlin layer manages transport, video rendering, audio playback, and UI.

### Connection Modes

OpenAutoLink supports two connection modes. Pick one in Settings → Connection on **both** apps (they must match).

**Car Hotspot mode (default, recommended):**
The car's built-in WiFi hotspot is the network. One or more phones join it as clients. The companion app on each phone advertises itself via mDNS and a tiny identity probe; the car app discovers all connected phones, picks the preferred one (or shows a picker), and dials it directly over TCP.

- ✅ **Multi-phone**: two drivers' phones can be connected to the car at once. Switch active phone with one tap.
- ✅ **Zero hotspot toggling**: phones treat the car's WiFi like home WiFi — saved once, auto-rejoins forever.
- ✅ **Fast cold-start**: car wakes → AP comes up immediately → phones auto-rejoin → projection resumes.
- Requires a vehicle with a built-in WiFi hotspot (most modern GM EVs include one).

**Phone Hotspot mode:**
The phone is the access point; the car is a client. Single-phone optimized — simpler if your car doesn't have a built-in hotspot or if you don't want to use it.

- **Configurable display** — fullscreen/windowed, safe area insets, DPI, margins, scaling mode
- **Stats overlay** — codec, resolution, FPS, bitrate, WiFi band, decoder info
- **Automatic reconnect** — car sleep → wake → projection resumes with no user interaction
- **Built-in diagnostics** — USB device scanner, network probe, remote log server (TCP 6555), VHAL browser

## EV Range Estimates

Native AAOS Google Maps has a private, per-vehicle EV profile (charge curves, aerodynamics, real DCFC power) it uses to predict battery-on-arrival. Apps cannot read that profile. OpenAutoLink builds the next best thing: a tunable energy model from real VHAL data plus an EPA-derived profile database, sent to Maps as the standard `VehicleEnergyModel` sensor.

Open it from **Settings → Diagnostics → Tweak EV Range Estimates**.

- **Detected vehicle card** — looks up `Make|Model|Year` from VHAL against a bundled database of 46 popular EVs (Blazer EV, Lyriq, Hummer EV, Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, Model 3/Y, IONIQ 5/6, EV6, EV9, ID.4, Rivian R1T/R1S, Polestar 2/3/4, Volvo EX30/EX90, BMW i4/iX, Mercedes EQE/EQS, Honda Prologue, Acura ZDX, and more). When matched, one tap applies EPA Wh/km and DCFC kW.
- **Four driving-rate modes**:
  - **Derived** *(default)* — uses the dashboard's range estimate. Behaves identically to previous releases.
  - **Multiplier** — scale the derived value 0.50× – 1.50× to nudge Maps optimistic or pessimistic.
  - **Manual** — set Wh/km directly with a slider (80–300).
  - **Learned** — auto-tunes from real driving. Computes a rolling Wh/km from `Δbattery ÷ Δdistance` (distance integrated from VHAL speed, since GM blocks `PERF_ODOMETER`). Per-vehicle state persists across car-off and reconnects. Skips ticks while charging or regenerating; rejects outliers; resets after long gaps.
- **Other tunable fields** — auxiliary load, aerodynamic coefficient, reserve %, max charge / discharge power.
- **Live readout** — shows current battery, range, charging power, derived rate, and the effective rate that will reach Maps.
- **Send Now** — push the updated model immediately so changes show up in Maps within seconds.
- **Profile database refresh** *(opt-in)* — fetch the latest profile JSON from network with a 4-second timeout, validated and cached locally. Defaults to OFF so the head unit doesn't depend on internet.

> The bundled profiles ship with the APK and work fully offline. Updates land via app releases or the manual refresh button — never as a silent background fetch.

## What You Need

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **AAOS vehicle** | Tested on 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV. Other GM EVs likely work |
| **Android phone** | Running the OpenAutoLink Companion app |
| **Google Play Console account** | To publish the AAOS app to your car |

That's it. No SBC, no Ethernet adapter, no extra hardware.

### Phone Setup

Install the **OpenAutoLink Companion** app on your phone. It handles:
- Starting the TCP server for the head unit to discover and connect to automatically.
- Android Auto auto-start once TCP connection from the car is made.

You can either download a prebuilt APK from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/actions/workflows/build-companion.yml) (click the latest run → Artifacts → `companion-debug-apk`) or build it yourself from the `companion/` directory.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Companion App (Phone)

**Option A — Download prebuilt APK:**
1. Go to [Build Companion APK](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/actions/workflows/build-companion.yml) on GitHub Actions.
2. Click the latest successful run.
3. Download the `companion-debug-apk` artifact.
4. Unzip and install the APK on your phone (enable "Install from unknown sources" if prompted).

**Option B — Build from source:**
```powershell
# Windows
cd companion
..\gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -r build/outputs/apk/debug/*.apk
```
```bash
# Linux / macOS
cd companion
../gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -r build/outputs/apk/debug/*.apk
```

The companion APK is signed with the Android debug key, which is fine for sideloading.

### 2. Build and Publish the Car App (AAOS)

Because this is an AAOS app, installation on the car goes through your own Google Play Console account:

1. Create a [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/) developer account.
2. Create a new app and configure an AAOS release track.
3. Change the package name in `app/build.gradle.kts` from `com.openautolink.app` to your own unique ID.
4. Generate an upload keystore:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\create-upload-keystore.ps1
   ```
5. Build and sign the release AAB:
   ```powershell
   # Windows (uses DPAPI-saved credentials)
   .\scripts\bundle-release.ps1
   ```
   ```bash
   # Linux / macOS (uses env-var credentials — see scripts/linux/README.md)
   export OAL_KEYSTORE_PASS='...'
   export OAL_KEY_PASS='...'
   scripts/linux/bundle-release.sh
   ```
6. Upload the AAB to Play Console, publish, and install on the car via Play Store.
7. Grant the **Car Information** permission: Settings → Apps → OpenAutoLink → Permissions.

### 3. Connect

OpenAutoLink defaults to **Car Hotspot mode** on both apps. Pick a mode in Settings → Connection (the choice must match on both ends).

#### Car Hotspot mode (recommended)

One-time setup:
1. **Enable the car's WiFi hotspot.** On the head unit: Settings → Network & Internet → Hotspot (or your manufacturer's equivalent). Note the SSID and password — you'll need them once on each phone.
2. **Connect each phone to the car's WiFi.** On the phone: Settings → WiFi → join the car's hotspot. Android remembers it like any home network, so this is a one-time tap per phone.
3. **Open the Companion app** and tap **Start** (or configure auto-start under Auto-Start → WiFi and pick the car's SSID from the multi-select list).
4. **Open OpenAutoLink on the car.** The phone chooser appears with every phone the car can see. Tap your phone to connect — that phone is now saved as your default and future drives auto-connect to it.

Day-to-day:
- Get in the car. Phone auto-rejoins the car WiFi. Companion auto-starts (if configured). Car app connects to your default phone automatically. Projection appears.
- **Multiple drivers?** Both phones can be on the car's WiFi at the same time. The car connects to your default and ignores the others. Tap the floating phone icon on the projection screen to switch — the chooser shows every visible phone with online/offline status.
- **Changing the default.** Tap a different phone in the chooser to switch to it for this drive, or use Settings → Connection → Known Phones → "Set Default" to change it permanently. Turn on "Always ask which phone to use" if you'd rather pick every time (useful for shared cars).
- **Forgetting a phone.** Settings → Connection → Known Phones → "Forget" removes a phone. If it was your default, the chooser will appear on the next connect so you can pick a new one.

#### Phone Hotspot mode

1. In Settings → Connection on both apps, switch to **Phone Hotspot**.
2. Turn on your phone's WiFi hotspot (Settings → Hotspot / Tethering).
3. On the head unit: Settings → Network & Internet → WiFi → join the phone's hotspot.
4. Open the Companion app and tap **Start**.
5. Open OpenAutoLink on the car.

> **Hotspot reconnect note:** When the car wakes from sleep, it should automatically rejoin the phone's hotspot — but in practice this can take 30+ seconds or occasionally fail. If the car doesn't reconnect, toggle the phone hotspot off and back on.

#### USB

1. Plug the phone into the head unit's USB port.
2. OpenAutoLink detects the device and performs the AOA v2 handshake.
3. Android Auto projection starts over the USB connection.

> **GM AAOS USB permission note:** GM head units ask for USB connection permission every time, even with "Always allow" checked. Known GM AAOS bug — there is no workaround.

### 4. Recommended Settings

- **Uninstall or disable music apps on the head unit.** If Spotify, YouTube Music, or another music app is installed on both the AAOS head unit and the phone, media controls (steering wheel buttons, play/pause, skip) can get confused — the car may try to control the AAOS app and the AA app simultaneously. Uninstall or disable the AAOS versions (Settings → Apps) so media controls go exclusively to the phone's AA session.
- **Disable the car's "Hey Google" detection.** The AAOS built-in Google Assistant and Android Auto's assistant will both try to respond to "Hey Google," causing conflicts. Turn off "Hey Google" detection in the car's Settings → Google → Google Assistant. The steering wheel voice button will still trigger the car's built-in assistant (this can't be changed), but "Hey Google" will go exclusively to the AA session on the phone.
- You can either unpair your phone entirely from the car BT, or what I do is leave it paired, but if you do: go into your phones BT settings for the car specific connection and toggle off Media and Phone Calls. those now flow through AA natively. leaving them on will cause GM's built in apps to take over rather than AA.

### Video and Display

## Resolution Tiers

| Resolution | Codec | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 480p (800×480) | H.264 | Always available |
| 720p (1280×720) | H.264 | Always available |
| 1080p (1920×1080) | H.264, H.265, VP9 | Default tier |
| 1440p (2560×1440) | H.265, VP9 | Requires AA Developer Mode |
| 4K (3840×2160) | H.265, VP9 | Requires AA Developer Mode |

By default, the app uses auto-negotiation — the phone picks the best codec and resolution it supports.

## Display Adaptation

OpenAutoLink tries to auto-compute a good  scale for AA UI to use for your screen, but you will want to play with and adjust it for your cars screen. This can be done using the DPI setting in the app. this controls the scale of the AA UI. There is no way to directly tell AA what layout to use, but you will notice by making changes to the DPI there are certain scales at which AA will change the layout...so choose a scale that is visually good on your screen, but also makes AA choose the wide side-by-side layout vs portrait layout (maps is a single wide banner at the top).

> **Blazer EV tip:** Pull the top safe area inset down ~50px.

### Historical

The original architecture used an SBC (single-board computer) running a C++ bridge binary and Python Bluetooth/WiFi scripts to relay Android Auto from the phone to the car over Ethernet. That was replaced by direct mode. The app initially reimplemented the AA protocol in Kotlin, which was then replaced by the current aasdk C++ JNI approach for protocol correctness and performance. The bridge code is preserved on the [`bridge-mode`](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/tree/bridge-mode) branch.

## Known Issues

- **H.265 video may appear green-tinted** on first connection for 30–45 seconds. May be Qualcomm-specific — not yet confirmed on other SoCs

If you encounter other problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mossyhub/openautolink/issues).

## Compatibility

Validated on a **2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV** running AAOS 12L. Other GM EVs on similar AAOS platforms likely work but have not been broadly tested. Non-GM AAOS vehicles may have different restrictions.

The companion app runs on any Android phone with Google Play Services (Nearby Connections requires it).

### Core Dependency

- **[opencardev/aasdk](https://github.com/opencardev/aasdk)** — The Android Auto protocol library at the heart of OpenAutoLink. Our [fork](https://github.com/mossyhub/aasdk) (branch `openautolink`) adds NavigationStatus extensions and EV energy model sensor types. The C++ library runs directly on the head unit via JNI.

### Where It Started

- **[metheos/carlink_native](https://github.com/metheos/carlink_native)** / **[lvalen91/carlink_native](https://github.com/lvalen91/carlink_native)** and the **[XDA CarLink thread](https://xdaforums.com/t/carlink.4774308)** inspired the original proof of concept.

### Projects I Learned From

- **[opencardev/openauto](https://github.com/opencardev/openauto)** — head unit emulator architecture.
- **[nickel110/WirelessAndroidAutoDongle](https://github.com/nickel110/WirelessAndroidAutoDongle)** — BT pairing and WiFi credential exchange reference.
- **[andrerinas/headunit-revived](https://github.com/nickel110/headunit-revived)** — AA receiver app reference for protocol implementation and feature ideas.

### On AI Assistance

This project is heavily AI-assisted, but grounded in extensive real hardware testing. The code moves faster with Copilot; the driveway testing, log analysis, and protocol debugging are what determine whether the result is actually good.

# Called by openautolink-headless when it receives a verified update binary.
# Arguments:
#   $1 — Path to the verified new binary (temp file)
#
# Flow:
#   1. Stop the openautolink service
#   2. Back up the current binary
#   3. Move the new binary into place
#   4. Set permissions
#   5. Start the openautolink service
#
# The service restart causes the app's TCP connections to drop.
# The app's auto-reconnect logic handles the rest.

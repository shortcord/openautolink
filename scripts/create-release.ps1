.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a GitHub Release with the bridge binary attached.

.DESCRIPTION
    - Reads version from secrets/version.properties
    - Creates a GitHub release with tag v<versionName>
    - Uploads the bridge binary from build-bridge-arm64/ (as openautolink-headless)
    - The AAB is NOT uploaded — it goes to Google Play Console separately
    - Requires: gh CLI authenticated

.EXAMPLE
    # After building:
    bash scripts/build-bridge-wsl.sh
    .\scripts\create-release.ps1
#>

    [string]$Notes = "",

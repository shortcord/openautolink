# GM AAOS APK Recon â€” Findings for OpenAutoLink

This document captures concrete, code-level findings from decompiling the GM
AAOS firmware APKs (Chevy Blazer EV, Android 12 / SDK 32, GM build
`VCUSR5-163/239`). Source dump and triage notes live in the gitignored
`recon_dump/` directory; this file is the durable summary of what we
learned and how it shaped the project.

> **Scope.** Only the highest-value APKs for OpenAutoLink were analysed in
> depth: `com_gm_aapclient` (32 MB) and `com_gm_hmi_androidauto` (45 MB).
> Other APKs in `recon_dump/apks/` (Ultifi services, EV energy model,
> trusted device, etc.) are catalogued but not deeply examined here.

## TL;DR

GM does **not** implement Android Auto from scratch â€” they ship Google's
`com.google.android.projection.*` library and wrap it in a thin GM service
layer (`gm.gal`, `gm.connection`, `com.gm.server.gal`). The interesting
parts for us are:

1. **Wire-level service IDs and audio config** â€” confirmed against our
   own implementation.
2. **The Service Discovery Response (SDR) `VideoConfiguration` fields they
   actually populate** â€” this is what the phone-side AA module honours,
   and several of our previous defaults were wrong.
3. **The aspect-ratio strategy** â€” they use `width_margin` /
   `height_margin` to letterbox a 16:9 codec frame inside a non-16:9 panel
   rect, and let the car compositor uniformly scale the inner content rect
   onto the panel. They do *not* use `pixel_aspect_ratio_e4` for AR
   compensation (it's hard-coded to `10000` = 1.0).
4. **Rectangular `content_insets` only.** The AA protocol has no
   non-rectangular safe-area / mask. Curved corners must be approximated
   by the largest rectangle that fits inside the curve.

These findings are the basis of the
[pixel-aspect.instructions.md](../.github/instructions/pixel-aspect.instructions.md)
rules, the auto-margin/margin-zoom renderer in
[ProjectionScreen.kt](../app/src/main/java/com/openautolink/app/ui/projection/ProjectionScreen.kt),
the per-tier margin computation in
[jni_session.cpp](../app/src/main/cpp/jni_session.cpp), and the GM-matching
SDR defaults in
[AasdkSdrConfig.kt](../app/src/main/java/com/openautolink/app/transport/aasdk/AasdkSdrConfig.kt).

## 1. AA service IDs

From `com.p087gm.server.gal.service.internals.utils.AAServiceID`:

| ID | Service |
|---:|---|
| 1 | DISPLAY (video) |
| 2 | INPUT (touch + key) |
| 3 | SENSOR |
| 4 | AUDIO_MEDIA_PCM |
| 5 | AUDIO_MEDIA_AAC |
| 6 | AUDIO_TTS_PCM |
| 7 | AUDIO_TTS_AAC |
| 8 | AUDIO_SOURCE (mic) |
| 9 | BLUETOOTH |
| 10 | MEDIA_PLAYBACK_STATUS |
| 11 | MEDIA_BROWSE |
| 12 | PHONE_STATUS |
| 16 | WIFI_PROJECTION |
| 20 | HOTWORD_VENDOR_EXTENSION |
| 21 | GAL_VENDOR_EXTENSION |
| 30 | NAVIGATION_STATUS |
| 31 | DISPLAY_AUXILIARY |
| 32 | DISPLAY_AUXILIARY_INPUT |
| 33 | DISPLAY_CLUSTER |
| 34 | DISPLAY_CLUSTER_INPUT |

Our [`jni_channel_handlers.cpp`](../app/src/main/cpp/jni_channel_handlers.cpp)
matches IDs 1â€“11 and 30/33; we don't currently implement 16 (WiFi
projection control), 20/21 (vendor extensions), or 31/32 (auxiliary
display).

## 2. Wireless transport: TCP server on port 5277

From `GALManager.startTcpServerMode()`:

```java
TransportFactory factory = TransportFactory.builder()
    .setContext(context)
    .setServerSocketProvider(serverSocketProvider)
    .build();
Log.i(TAG, "Starting TCP server mode on port 30515");
factory.open(null, new WireLessTransportFactoryCallback(sessionId));
```

(The `30515` constant in the log is an internal mDNS service port; the
actual AA TCP listener is `5277`, the well-known wireless AA port â€” confirmed
by the WiFiInfoResponse handler in our companion's `TcpAdvertiser`.)

Notable preconditions:

- The car requires a **valid BT MAC** (`BluetoothProxy.getHostAddress()`)
  before opening the TCP server. The MAC is sent in the AA wireless
  bootstrap so the phone knows which device to dial.
- The car is the TCP **server**; the phone dials in. Our companion app
  inverts this in Car-Hotspot mode (companion is the server; the car app
  dials the companion). Both modes match this pattern at the AA layer â€”
  what differs is which endpoint runs the TCP listener.

## 3. Audio configuration â€” only 4 streams, not 5

From `GALManager.registerAudioSinkService`:

```java
mMediaStreamPCMPlayer  = new AudioPlayer("MEDIA CHANNEL_PCM",     AUDIO_STREAM_MEDIA,    48000, 12, 2, ...);
mTtsStreamPCMPlayer    = new AudioPlayer("GUIDANCE CHANNEL_PCM",  AUDIO_STREAM_GUIDANCE, 48000, 4,  2, ...);
mMediaStreamAACPlayer  = new AudioPlayer("MEDIA CHANNEL_AAC",     AUDIO_STREAM_MEDIA,    48000, 12, 2, ...);
mTtsStreamAACPlayer    = new AudioPlayer("GUIDANCE CHANNEL_AAC",  AUDIO_STREAM_GUIDANCE, 48000, 4,  2, ...);
```

- GM uses only **2 logical streams**: `MEDIA` and `GUIDANCE`. There is no
  separate ALERT/SYSTEM/SIRI purpose â€” the phone routes those through one
  of the two.
- All sinks are **48 kHz / 16-bit**. Media is stereo (channel mask `12` =
  `CHANNEL_OUT_FRONT_LEFT | FRONT_RIGHT`); guidance is mono (mask `4` =
  `FRONT_CENTER`).
- **PCM and AAC are separate AAServiceIDs** (4/5 and 6/7). GM advertises
  both, then negotiates per-session. This explains why the phone sometimes
  flips codecs mid-session â€” same logical stream, different codec.

We have a more granular 5-purpose model in [audio/](../app/src/main/java/com/openautolink/app/audio).
This is fine â€” extra purposes simply receive nothing if the phone never
emits them â€” but allocating empty `AudioTrack`s is small wasted work. Not
worth changing unless we see the wasted allocation in a profiler.

## 4. SDR `VideoConfiguration` â€” the GM defaults

From `GALDisplayManager.buildVC` (lightly reformatted):

```java
VideoConfiguration.newBuilder()
    .setCodecResolution(VIDEO_1920x1080 | VIDEO_1280x720 | VIDEO_800x480)
    .setFrameRate(VIDEO_FPS_60)
    .setWidthMargin(wm)              // pixels of black bar L+R inside the codec frame
    .setHeightMargin(hm)             // pixels of black bar T+B inside the codec frame
    .setDensity(scaledDensity)       // logical DPI (sized so UI elements end up correct)
    .setRealDensity(realDensity)     // physical DPI for fonts
    .setDecoderAdditionalDepth(1)    // extra reordered frames the HU can buffer
    .setViewingDistance(700)         // mm from driver eye to display
    .setPixelAspectRatioE4(10000)    // = 1.0, ALWAYS. Phone ignores non-1.0.
    .setUiConfig(uiConfig);          // content_insets, stable_content_insets, margins
```

GM advertises only **`VIDEO_1920x1080`, `VIDEO_1280x720`, `VIDEO_800x480`**
(in that order) regardless of trim. The full `VideoCodecResolutionType`
enum supports up to `VIDEO_3840x2160` plus portrait mirrors
(`VIDEO_720x1280` â€¦ `VIDEO_2160x3840`); GM's choice to omit them keeps the
session bandwidth/CPU budget tight on retail trims.

### What the phone actually honours

- `width_margin` / `height_margin` â€” yes, phone respects these and packs
  margin pixels at the **bottom and right** (UI top-left anchored inside
  the inner content rect).
- `density` and `real_density` â€” yes, used for UI sizing.
- `decoder_additional_depth` â€” yes; impacts encoder pacing.
- `viewing_distance` â€” yes; subtle font-size effect.
- `pixel_aspect_ratio_e4` â€” **ignored**. We confirmed this via experiment
  on multiple phones; setting non-1.0 produces no change. GM hardcodes
  `10000` and uses margins instead.
- `UiConfig.content_insets` / `stable_content_insets` â€” yes, AA places
  dropdowns/dialogs inside.
- `UiConfig.margins` â€” phones we tested ignore this. GM still sends it
  (split half/half top/bottom and left/right) defensively. We mirror
  that â€” see
  [jni_session.cpp `applyVideoConfig`](../app/src/main/cpp/jni_session.cpp).

### Key formulas

`getScaledDensity` and `getRealDensity` compute density assuming the inner
content rect (codec frame minus margins) maps **uniformly** onto the
projection area:

```text
fWidth        = projectionArea.width / (codec.width  - width_margin)
scaledDensity = round(reportedDensity / fWidth)              // floor MINIMUM_SCALED_DENSITY = 120
realDensity   = round((codec.height - height_margin) / physicalHeightInches)
```

`MINIMAL_SCALE_DPI_480P` is 96 (configurable via system prop
`gal_min_dpi_480p`); all higher tiers floor at 120 dpi.

## 5. Aspect-ratio strategy: margins, not pixel_aspect

This was the most consequential discovery. AA's protocol gives the
phone **no** way to pre-distort UI pixels (i.e. render non-square pixels
to compensate for downstream non-uniform stretch). The closest field is
`pixel_aspect_ratio_e4`, which the phone ignores.

GM's solution is:

1. Pick a 16:9 codec frame from `{1920Ã—1080, 1280Ã—720, 800Ã—480}`.
2. Compute `width_margin` / `height_margin` so the **inner content rect**
   `(codecW âˆ’ wm) Ã— (codecH âˆ’ hm)` matches the panel's **projection area**
   aspect ratio. For a 2914Ã—1134 (â‰ˆ 2.57:1) Blazer panel + 1080p codec:
   `hm â‰ˆ 333` â†’ inner `1920Ã—747` â‰ˆ 2.57:1.
3. The car compositor scales the inner rect uniformly onto the projection
   area. Square pixels survive intact.
4. Adjust `density` per the formula above so UI elements arrive at the
   intended physical size after that uniform scale.

We mirror this in [`MarginAutoCalc`](../app/src/main/java/com/openautolink/app/video/MarginAutoCalc.kt)
and the C++ `autoMargins` lambda in
[jni_session.cpp](../app/src/main/cpp/jni_session.cpp). Our renderer goes
one step further than GM: instead of letterboxing the inner rect inside
the panel, we **inflate the SurfaceView so margin pixels overflow the
parent's `clipToBounds()`** â€” same uniform-scale outcome, but the
projection occupies the full panel rather than reserving panel area for
GM's HMI chrome. See
[ProjectionScreen.kt](../app/src/main/java/com/openautolink/app/ui/projection/ProjectionScreen.kt).

### Resolution menu has portrait mirrors

`VideoCodecResolutionType.proto` (in our aasdk fork) exposes the full
enum:

```text
VIDEO_800x480      = 1   // landscape only
VIDEO_1280x720     = 2
VIDEO_1920x1080    = 3
VIDEO_2560x1440    = 4
VIDEO_3840x2160    = 5
VIDEO_720x1280     = 6   // portrait variants
VIDEO_1080x1920    = 7
VIDEO_1440x2560    = 8
VIDEO_2160x3840    = 9
```

For portrait panels we advertise tiers 6â€“9 instead of 1â€“5 (no portrait
480p in the spec). For landscape panels both branches work; we keep the
landscape list. See
[jni_session.cpp](../app/src/main/cpp/jni_session.cpp) auto-negotiate
branch.

## 6. Display layout â€” `PhysicalDisplay` schema

`HuDisplayUtil.loadDisplayConfig` reads JSON files named
`DISPLAY_<SIZE>.json` shipped in the HMI APK assets, one per trim
(`DISPLAY_CHEVY_FF`, `DISPLAY_FF`, `DISPLAY_PORTRAIT_15_INCH`, etc.).
Schema (from `PhysicalDisplay.java` / `HuDisplay.java` / `Area.java`):

```jsonc
{
  "view_distance": 700,                  // mm to driver eye
  "suggested_density": 160,              // logical DPI
  "screen_width": 2914, "screen_height": 1134,
  "safe_area": { "x": â€¦, "y": â€¦, "width": â€¦, "height": â€¦ },
  "hu_display": [
    {
      "hu_display_type": "Main",         // "Main"|"BigCard"|"Auxiliary"|"Cluster"
      "fill_projection_area": true,
      "projection_area": { â€¦ },          // panel rect reserved for AA
      "content_area":    { â€¦ },          // safe sub-rect inside projection_area
      "safe_area":       { â€¦ }
    }
  ]
}
```

Important consequence: **GM does *not* render AA full-screen**. They
reserve panel area for native HMI chrome (top status bar + side dock) and
give AA only the `projection_area` sub-rect. Our app full-screens AA by
default; this is a design difference, not a bug.

## 7. Touch coordinates

From `GALManager.startVideo` and `GALDisplay.setTouchScaleRatio`:

```java
mActiveDisplay.setTouchScaleRatio(
    (float) contentSize.getWidth()  / (float) screenRect.width(),
    (float) contentSize.getHeight() / (float) screenRect.height());
```

Touch events from the panel are scaled into the **codec coordinate
space**, then sent on the input service. The phone scales them again to
its render space.

We do the same thing in our pointerInteropFilter overlay â€” see
[ProjectionScreen.kt](../app/src/main/java/com/openautolink/app/ui/projection/ProjectionScreen.kt).
The crucial detail: the touch destination is the **codec inner rect**
(`[0, innerW] Ã— [0, innerH]`), not the full codec frame.

## 8. Surface lifecycle and sleep/wake

Two patterns from `GALManager`:

### Surface binding is delayed until codec resolution arrives

```java
if (surface == null || mActiveDisplay.getCodecResolution() == null) {
    Log.d(TAG, "Video codec resolution not known -- delay MSG_UPDATE_SURFACE");
    mDelayedUpdateSurfaceArgs = someArgs;
}
```

GM does not pre-warm the decoder. We can do better: pre-instantiate
`MediaCodec` at app start using a known-supported tier (1280Ã—720 H.264
baseline-profile is universally supported), so the time from "phone's
first IDR" to "first rendered frame" is just the IDR drain. Especially
beneficial in **manual** mode where we know the exact codec frame
dimensions in advance â€” see the discussion in
[work-plan.md](work-plan.md). Not yet implemented as of this writing.

### `GALPowerOffManager` â€” phone-call / VR transients

When the user starts a phone call or voice-recognition session **while
AA is in foreground**, GM does **not** tear down the session. They overlay
a power-off-style screen and track restoration with two atomic flags
(`mShouldRestorePowerOffForPhone`, `mShouldRestorePowerOffForVR`) so the
session is preserved across transient events.

For our reconnect path, the equivalent is: when the car genuinely
suspends, the TCP socket dies and we treat it as fresh-connect; for
transient events (phone call, VR), we should hide the surface but keep the
session â€” same effect as GM, different mechanism.

## 9. Steering-wheel keycodes (`dispatchKeyEvent`)

| Range | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| 12â€“15 | Routed to `NavigationFocusManager.handleNavKeyEvent` |
| 16â€“19 | Phone keys â€” 16 = `KEYCODE_TEL`, sent only if AA is in foreground |
| 20â€“23 | Media keys â€” 20 = `KEYCODE_MEDIA`, sent only if media stream has audio focus |
| default | Routed to `VoiceSessionManager.onVRKeyEvent` (PTT/Hotword) |

We don't currently implement steering-wheel input. When we do, this is
the reference mapping.

## 10. ProjectionState lifecycle

From `gm.connection.ProjectionProfile.ProjectionState`:

```text
INVALID, STOPPING, STOPPED, STARTING, STARTED, SUSPENDED,
STOPPED_BY_CONNECTION_ERROR, STOPPED_BY_WIFI_CONGESTION, STOPPED_BY_MD_BYE
```

`STOPPED_BY_WIFI_CONGESTION` is a real GM-recognised reason â€” confirms
that WiFi-quality teardowns happen and aren't bugs in our companion.
Worth surfacing as a separate diagnostic category if we see it in field
logs.

## 11. SDV bridges â€” gated by system prop

| APK | Library | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| `com_gm_sdv_service_canbridge` | `libcanbridge.so` | `persist.sys.gm.sdv_enable` (off by default on retail) |
| `com_gm_sdv_service_udsbridge` | `libudsbridge.so` | **None** â€” Binder registered at boot |

The CAN bridge is the SDV (Software Defined Vehicle) interface to the
in-vehicle network. The UDS bridge speaks ISO 14229 (diagnostics / ECU
flashing). Neither is relevant to projection; both are interesting future
research targets for diagnostics features. Real protocol surface lives in
the `.so` files (Ghidra/BinaryNinja), not the Java wrappers (which just
load the lib and forward Binder calls).

## 12. APKs catalogued but not analysed in depth

These exist in `recon_dump/apks/` and may be worth deeper inspection
later:

- `com_gm_lcm` â€” Lifecycle Manager (sleep/wake state machine).
- `com_gm_phonezoneaudio_presentation` â€” multi-zone audio routing.
- `com_gm_hmi_applecarplay` â€” CarPlay HMI (parked on
  `feature/carplay-recon`).
- `com_gm_drivemode`, `com_gm_offroad`, `com_gm_valetmode`,
  `com_gm_teenmode`, `com_gm_isaplugin` â€” feature-flag-gated drive
  modes; not protocol-relevant but interesting for reverse-engineering
  available modes per VIN.
- `com_gm_ultifi_*` â€” Ultifi SDV service shells around vehicle
  subsystems (body access, climate, propulsion, etc.).
- `com_google_android_apps_automotive_templates_host` â€” the GAS
  templates host. Reference for non-projected templated apps in AAOS;
  out of scope for the projection layer.

## Decompilation tooling

- `jadx 1.5.3` with `--deobf` and `-r` (resource extraction).
- For >50 MB APKs: `JADX_OPTS="-Xmx12g"` and one APK at a time (a 32-bit
  default heap will OOM mid-decompile).
- The Templates Host APK in our dump was originally truncated (no ZIP
  EOCD record); a re-pull from the head unit produced a complete file.
- See [recon_dump/decompile.ps1](../recon_dump/decompile.ps1) for the
  memory-bounded batch runner.

## Provenance

Captured device: Chevrolet Blazer EV (RPO `aegean`, GM family `aegean`,
SDK 32, fingerprint `gm/aegean_orange/aegean:12/VCUSR5-163/239:user/release-keys`).
Pulled via `adb pull` while in factory engineering mode; 304 packages,
2.53 GB of APKs total. Triage is in [`recon_dump/TRIAGE.md`](../recon_dump/TRIAGE.md)
(gitignored). This file is the durable, in-repo summary intended to
survive after the recon dump is archived.


## 10. ADB unlock surface â€” GM's full diagnostic backdoor

Deep dive into `com_gm_domain_server_delayed.apk` (the `android.uid.system`-privileged service host) and `com_android_car_developeroptions.apk` revealed that **GM ships a complete, undisabled mechanism for enabling USB-ADB on production head units**. It is intended for dealers and the GM Tech 2 / GDS / DPS scan tools, but the entry points are still present on retail vehicles. This section catalogues every entry point we found and their reachability from outside `android.uid.system`.

### 10.1 Why plugging USB into the armrest port does nothing

The single armrest USB-A port wired to the head unit's Android Auto pipeline is **a USB host port at boot**, not a device port. The head unit drives it as host so a phone plugged in enumerates as a USB Accessory / NCM for wired AA. From `init.carplay.rc` and `init.carlife.rc` we see ConfigFS gadgets `g1` (CarPlay) and `g3` (CarLife) but **no ADB function listed at all** â€” the port is never advertised as an ADB-capable gadget at boot.

The dual-role USB port is mediated by a **Microchip / Aptiv bridge-chip hub** (`BridgeChipManager`, `CPMManager`, `HubObject` in `com.p006gm.server.screenprojection.RemoteDeviceService`). On a stock car the hub keeps the connector wired upstream (head unit = host, port = downstream). To get ADB you need to flip a specific hub port to **role-reversal** so the head unit becomes the device. That flip is performed exclusively by `RDMSADBHandler.enableAdb()` via `UsbUtils.sendNativeRoleReversalForDevice()` (native UDC: `a600000.dwc3`) or via the bridge chip's `bcm.set(port, "ADB", 0)`.

**Conclusion:** even with `Settings.Global.adb_enabled = 1` (which the AOSP dev-options toggle would flip), no ADB device enumerates on the cable until `RDMSADBEnable(true)` runs â€” because nothing else flips the hub port direction or sets `sys.usb.controller` / `sys.usb.config = adb`. **The dev-options ADB toggle alone is a dead end on this hardware.**

### 10.2 The complete enable path â€” what dealer tools actually do

```
UDS Routine 0x0332           ServiceManager binder            JNI native              shell script
[0x42 0x00 0x10 0x01]    â”€â”€â–º  com.gm.server.                 libRDMSJNI.so       /system/bin/ADBoverBCS.sh on

                              .RDMSADBEnable(true)
                                       â”‚
                                       â–¼
                              RDMSADBHandler.enableAdb()
                              â”œâ”€â”€ BridgeChipManager.reserve("ADB")
                              â”œâ”€â”€ isBCSHub() ? bcm.set(port, "ADB", 0) : UsbUtils.sendNativeRoleReversalForDevice()
                              â”œâ”€â”€ SystemProperties.set("sys.usb.controller", "a600000.dwc3" | "dabr_udc.0")
                              â”œâ”€â”€ SystemProperties.set("vendor.gm.test.adb", "on")
                              â””â”€â”€ Settings.Global.adb_enabled = 1
```

After this sequence the head unit re-enumerates on the previously-host port as a Qualcomm ADB device (typical VID `0x05c6`).

### 10.3 The four entry points

#### A. AIDL binder: `com.gm.server.screenprojection.RDMSADBHandler`

**Interface** (`gm.connection.IRDMSADBHandler`):

```java
int RDMSADBEnable(boolean enable);   // transaction code 1
```

**Registration** ([RemoteDeviceService.java:226](../recon_dump/apks/com_gm_domain_server_delayed/java_src/com/p006gm/server/screenprojection/RemoteDeviceService/RemoteDeviceService.java)):

```java
ServiceManager.addService(
    "com.gm.server.screenprojection.RDMSADBHandler",
    this.mRDMSADBHandler.asBinder(),
    /*allowIsolated=*/ false);
```

**Permission check in `onTransact`: NONE.** Just `parcel.enforceInterface(DESCRIPTOR)` â€” any caller that can obtain the binder reference can invoke the method.

**Reachability gate:** `ServiceManager.getService(name)` from an unprivileged app:

- The method is `@hide` â€” needs reflection or `@SystemApi` (Car-API) access.
- More importantly: the service is registered with the **default SELinux service-manager label** (`u:object_r:default_android_service:s0` unless GM added an entry to `service_contexts`, which we cannot verify without shell). On AOSP 12, `untrusted_app` and `isolated_app` SIDs do **not** have `service_manager:find` on `default_android_service`. They cannot get the binder.
- `priv_app` and `system_app` SIDs *can*.

**To test from our own app (sideloaded, non-system-signed):**

```kotlin
val sm = Class.forName("android.os.ServiceManager")
val getService = sm.getMethod("getService", String::class.java)
val binder = getService.invoke(null, "com.gm.server.screenprojection.RDMSADBHandler") as android.os.IBinder?
// If null  â†’ SELinux blocked us (expected for untrusted_app).
// If not null â†’ call RDMSADBEnable via the Proxy stub. We win.
```

Worth doing as a one-shot probe even though we expect `null`. If it returns non-null, that's the entire root-of-trust on this car. The probe is in [tools/RdmsProbeActivity.kt](#) (proposed; not yet written).

#### B. `vendor.gm.test.adb` system-property polling backdoor

In [RemoteDeviceService.monitorAdb()](../recon_dump/apks/com_gm_domain_server_delayed/java_src/com/p006gm/server/screenprojection/RemoteDeviceService/RemoteDeviceService.java) (line ~510):

```java
while (!RemoteDeviceService.this.shutdown) {
    boolean currentAdbSetting = RemoteDeviceServiceWrapper.getAdbPersistStatus();
    boolean adbOnProp = SystemProperties.getBoolean("vendor.gm.test.adb", currentAdbSetting);
    if (currentAdbSetting != adbOnProp) {
        Log.i(TAG, "adbPropThread.adb property was found to be manually changed to: " + adbOnProp);
        RemoteDeviceService.this.changeAdbSetting(adbOnProp);
    }
    Thread.sleep(1000L);
}
```

**This polls the system property `vendor.gm.test.adb` once per second** and, on transition, runs the same full ADB-enable dance (`enableAdb()` â†’ role-reversal â†’ `Settings.Global.adb_enabled=1` â†’ `sys.usb.config=adb`).

**The unlock command, if you ever have a shell, is literally:**

```bash
setprop vendor.gm.test.adb 1     # wait 1 second â†’ ADB device appears on USB
```

**Reachability from a non-system app:** `SystemProperties.set()` is gated by `property_contexts`. `vendor.gm.test.*` likely has a custom selinux context. Most plausible contexts and who can write:

| Context | Writable by |
|---|---|
| `vendor_default_prop` | nobody outside vendor (default) |
| `system_prop` | `system_app`, `system_server` |
| `exported_default_prop` | platform_app, system_app |

Without `getprop -Z vendor.gm.test.adb` from a shell we can't tell which. **Almost certainly not writable by `untrusted_app`.** But it's the cleanest path if/when we ever get a one-shot privileged exec (e.g. via the JNI path below).

#### C. UDS Routine 0x0332 (the dealer path)

[RID0332Handler.java](../recon_dump/apks/com_gm_domain_server_delayed/java_src/com/p006gm/server/diagnostics_service/diagnostics/handle/globalb/common/rid/RID0332Handler.java) handles diagnostic Routine Identifier 0x0332. Payload (4 bytes):

| Byte | Value | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | `0x42` | compId (must equal 66) |
| 1â€“2 | `0x0010` | dataId (must equal 16) |
| 3 | `0x01` | 1 = enable ADB, 0 = disable |

On a valid request it calls `ServiceManager.getService("com.gm.server.screenprojection.RDMSADBHandler").RDMSADBEnable(true)` and also writes `Settings.Global.adb_enabled = 1`. This is the **exact RID a GM Tech 2 / GDS scan tool uses to enable ADB at a dealer**.

Transport: the routine handler is registered inside `com.gm.server.diagnostics_service.DiagnosticsService`. We have not yet confirmed which physical transport delivers it â€” candidates are:

1. **DoIP over Ethernet** to the gateway module (most likely; ISO 13400). The head unit listens on a DoIP-internal TCP socket.
2. **OBD-II via the central gateway** routing UDS over CAN to the IVI ECU (less likely given AAOS uses Ethernet-internal architecture).
3. **An internal Binder route** for the dealer app (Tech 2 / GDS connects to the gateway, which proxies UDS into the IVI domain).

The handler **does not check `SecurityAccess` level itself** â€” that gate lives in `SecurityAccessNotificationHandler`, which is an **upstream** session-state setter, not an enforcement point. The session-management layer above the handler is what would reject the request if SecurityAccess (UDS 0x27) hasn't been unlocked. That algorithm is proprietary GM seed/key â€” independently reversed by communities for older GM platforms, unknown status for Aegean/SDV.

**Practical exploitation:** if you have OBD-II + a J2534 / Passthru device that can speak UDS to the IVI ECU and you have a seed/key implementation for the SDV platform, you send Routine Control (0x31) with sub-function Start (0x01), RID `0x0332`, payload `[0x42, 0x00, 0x10, 0x01]`. The car's USB port re-enumerates as ADB in under 2 seconds. We have not attempted this. **Highest-value real-world attack** â€” likely how aftermarket "GM ADB enabler" services on enthusiast forums operate.

#### D. `RDMSManager` JNI primitive (system-uid shell exec)

This is the most alarming code in the whole APK. [gm.rdmsmanager.RDMSManager](../recon_dump/apks/com_gm_domain_server_delayed/java_src/gm/rdmsmanager/RDMSManager.java) wraps `libRDMSJNI.so` and exposes:

```java
public native void nativeExecShellCmd(String path);
public native void nativeExecShellCmd(String path, String linkName);   // path + arg
public native void nativeChangeUsbSetting(String path, String value);  // write configfs
public native String nativeReadFile(String path);                      // read arbitrary file
```

Used internally:

```java
RDMSManager.getInstance().execShellCmd("/system/bin/ADBoverBCS.sh", "on");
RDMSManager.getInstance().execShellCmd("/system/bin/carplay.sh");
RDMSManager.getInstance().execShellCmd("/system/bin/carplay3.sh", "usb0");
```

`/system/bin/ADBoverBCS.sh on` is **the actual ADB-enable shell script** invoked by the bridge-chip path. It is shipped on-device under `/system/bin/`. The native lib runs in the calling process's UID, which here is `android.uid.system`. **This is, by design, a system-UID shell-exec primitive.**

It is not directly exposed via any Binder/Intent we could find â€” but it is loaded into a `system`-UID process that runs binders accessible across the platform. If any of those binders has an injection-style bug ("pass user-controlled string to `execShellCmd`"), the IVI domain is owned. We have not audited every callsite, but the recipe is: `grep -R execShellCmd com_gm_*` across all decompiled APKs. None of the current callers in `com_gm_domain_server_delayed` pass attacker-controllable strings.

### 10.4 Unrelated developer-mode side-channels (none useful on retail)

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| `com_android_car_developeroptions` | Stock AOSP. Build-number 7-tap flow works, sets `Settings.Global.development_settings_enabled=1`. Useless without RDMSADBHandler also flipping the hub. |
| `chevrolet_vcd_chevy_ff_developeroptions` (6.4 KB RRO) | Pure cosmetic overlay on the switch bar. No enabler logic. |
| `TestInterface` (RDMS broadcast receiver) | Gated by `!ro.build.tags.contains("release-keys")`. Disabled on retail. |
| `com.gm.lcddprovision` (factory line calibration) | Signature-protected by `com.gm.permission.LCDD_PROVISION` (`signature|privileged`). Out of reach. |
| `com.gm.usbmountreceiver` | Just auto-copies log files when a USB drive is plugged in. No ADB path. |
| `com_gm_updater` + `vendor.gm.swupdate@1.0` HAL | OEM SWUpdate (`gm.update.UpdateEngineService`). Signature-verified PackageStatus. Not exploitable as a backdoor. |
| `gm.onstar.OnStarRemoteReflashManager` | Visible in `service list`. Cloud-driven reflash via OnStar telematics. Not customer-reachable. |
| `com.android.shell` | Stock AOSP shell APK (4-bit). Has dumpstate path. Not exploitable. |
| `init.protokey_recovery.rc` | Hands off to bootloader recovery â€” unrelated to userspace ADB. |
| `com_android_managedprovisioning` | Generic MDM provisioning. No ADB unlock. |

### 10.5 Wireless ADB (`adb_wifi_enabled`)

`com_android_car_developeroptions` includes `WirelessDebuggingPreferenceController` which writes `Settings.Global.adb_wifi_enabled = 1`. **This does NOT depend on hub role-reversal** â€” it spawns `adbd` listening on a TCP port (with mDNS pairing) over whatever network interface the device is attached to. If you can reach the dev-options screen and flip wireless debugging, you don't need USB at all.

The catch: `adbd` only starts if `ro.debuggable=1` OR if the user has paired via `adb pair`. On `release-keys` builds it should still start in the latter mode (Android 11+ wireless ADB does not require `ro.debuggable`). Worth trying once we have a UI path into dev options.

**To probe wireless debugging from our own app on the head unit:**

```kotlin
// Both writes require android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS (signature|privileged).
// As an unprivileged app these will SecurityException, but the error tells us
// whether the gate is "you need to be system" vs "feature is locked at HAL".
Settings.Global.putInt(contentResolver, "development_settings_enabled", 1)
Settings.Global.putInt(contentResolver, "adb_wifi_enabled", 1)
```

If we ever get `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` (e.g. via a sideloaded shell app with that permission granted manually through `pm grant`), this becomes a one-tap unlock. ADB wireless pairing on the same network as the car would then work without ever touching the USB hub.

### 10.6 Direct-launch shortcut: jump straight to dev options

This works **today** from any app (including ours) regardless of any GM customisation that hides the Build-number breadcrumb in their Settings UI:

```kotlin
// CarDevelopmentSettingsDashboardActivity is exported, intent-filter priority 1,
// android.intent.category.DEFAULT. Any app can resolve and start it.
startActivity(
    Intent("android.settings.APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT_SETTINGS")
        .addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)
)
```

If the activity launches but the screen is empty (`development_settings_enabled=0`), the user still needs to do the 7-tap dance on Build number inside the About screen â€” but at least we've bypassed any GM customisation that buried that path.

### 10.7 Pen-test action items (in priority order)

1. **Probe `ServiceManager.getService("com.gm.server.screenprojection.RDMSADBHandler")` from our sideloaded app** â€” single Kotlin reflection call, instant pass/fail. If it returns non-null, we win without dealer tools. Even if it fails, the `SecurityException` or `null` result tells us exactly which SELinux rule blocked us, which is useful intel.
2. **Probe `SystemProperties.get("vendor.gm.test.adb")` reachability** â€” read first (likely accessible), then attempt `SystemProperties.set("vendor.gm.test.adb", "1")`. The `set` will throw on selinux-deny; the exception class confirms `property_contexts` is the gate.
3. **Add a dev-only "Open AAOS Dev Options" button to our settings screen** â€” one-tap intent launch (10.6). Costs nothing, helps any future testing.
4. **Catalogue all callers of `RDMSManager.execShellCmd` across every APK** â€” already done for `com_gm_domain_server_delayed`; do the same sweep across the remaining 240 undecompiled APKs to look for an exposed binder that takes user input and pipes it into `execShellCmd`. That would be a critical-severity issue worth responsible-disclosing to GM, and a working root in the meantime.
5. **Confirm DoIP/UDS transport for RID 0x0332** â€” read `com.gm.server.diagnostics_service.DiagnosticsService` decompiled output to find the listening socket/binder. If we ever stand up a J2534 rig, this is the dealer path to ADB.
6. **Re-examine `gm.onstar.OnStarRemoteReflashManager`** â€” telematics-driven reflash service. If GM ever uses it to push a debug-keys build to a specific VIN, the seam between "trusted cloud signal" and "do something privileged" is the attacker surface.

### 10.8 Verdict

**Direct USB-ADB on a stock retail Blazer EV is not casually attainable.** All four enable paths require either:

- `android.uid.system` signature (RDMSADBHandler binder, monitorAdb prop write, JNI exec) â€” gated by GM's release-keys signing cert.
- UDS Routine 0x0332 via OBD-II + GM SecurityAccess seed/key (RID0332Handler) â€” gated by proprietary crypto.

The **highest-realism attack** is the dealer UDS path (10.3.C). The **highest-value defensive bug-class** to look for is an unauthenticated binder/intent that proxies into `RDMSManager.execShellCmd`. Worth the audit time across the remaining APKs.

For OpenAutoLink specifically, none of this is on the critical path â€” we don't need ADB on the head unit to develop our app, we have wireless debugging on the phone side, and the in-app Remote Log Server (TCP 6555) covers our diagnostics. But the recon answers the long-standing "why doesn't a USB cable in the AA port enumerate" question definitively, and gives us a clear unlock recipe if we ever do need it.


## 11. Confused-deputy audit across system-uid APKs (2026-05-18)

After the Â§10 conclusion that every direct ADB-enable path was gated by SELinux
or `signatureOrSystem` permissions, we did a broader audit looking for a
**confused-deputy bug**: an exported component in a privileged process that
accepts attacker-controlled input and forwards it into a privileged sink
(`Settings.Global.put*`, `SystemProperties.set`, `Runtime.exec`,
`grantRuntimePermission`, etc.). If any such component exists, an
unprivileged sideloaded app can ride its UID's permissions to achieve
the privileged effect â€” including potentially flipping
`Settings.Global.adb_wifi_enabled`.

### 11.1 Tooling produced

Three reusable scanners live in `recon_dump/`. Each one builds on the
previous and produces a CSV for follow-up analysis.

- **`scan-attack-surface.ps1`** â€” decodes every decompiled APK's manifest
  via `aapt`, emits `attack-surface.csv` containing every
  `(activity|service|receiver|provider)` with `exported=true`, its
  `android:permission` (and resolved protection level), its intent-filter
  actions, and a crude grep of the component's own class file for
  privileged sinks. Also prints a summary sorted by *number of permission-less
  exported components*.
- **`scan-taint-flow.ps1`** â€” for each exported + no-permission component,
  reads only its declared `.java` class file and looks for both
  `getStringExtra`-class sources *and* a privileged sink. Flags components
  where source and sink lines are within ~30 lines of each other as **HIGH**.
- **`scan-taint-flow-deep.ps1`** â€” same heuristic but scanning the
  **entire package directory** of each component, not just the class file.
  This catches the common pattern where a thin BroadcastReceiver delegates
  work to a sibling helper class (which is where the real source-to-sink
  flow lives).

Run them in order; the deep scanner is the one with usable signal.

### 11.2 Audit corpus

This pass decompiled an additional 14 high-value system-uid APKs on top of
what Â§10 already covered:

```
com_android_car                  com_gm_ultifi_bus
com_android_systemui             com_gm_ultifi_lvmapp
com_android_phone                com_gm_homescreen
com_android_bluetooth            com_gm_rhmi
com_android_providers_settings   com_gm_deviceinformation
com_android_providers_telephony  com_gm_linkviewer
com_ultifi_vehicle_session       com_gm_ddb_contentprovider
```

Combined with the Â§10 corpus, the audit covered every system-uid APK on the
device except the >100 MB ones (`com_gm_hmi_sxm`, `com_gm_vehicleinfo`,
`com_google_android_gms`, `com_gm_ultifi_tipsandtour`), which were skipped
for time. The skipped APKs are infotainment-feature payloads, not
privilege-management code; lower a-priori value.

### 11.3 Top three confirmed findings

Each of these is a real cross-UID weakness on the live head unit. None of
them unlocks ADB, but all are worth a low-severity report to GM.

#### Finding A â€” `com.gm.settings.receivers.DeviceConnectionEventReceiver` UI spoofing

| | |
|---|---|
| APK | `com.gm.hmi.connection` |
| UID | `android.uid.system` |
| Component | `BroadcastReceiver`, `android:exported=true`, **no `android:permission`** |
| Intent-filter actions | `gm.connection.DEVICE_CONNECTION_EVENT`, `gm.dcm.intent.action.wifi.connect.status.changed` |
| Class | `com.gm.settings.receivers.DeviceConnectionEventReceiver` |
| Bug class | CWE-862 Missing Authorization |

The whole onReceive body is:

```java
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d("DeviceConnectionEventReceiver", "onReceive action: " + intent.getAction());
    context.startService(SettingsDeviceService.createDeviceServiceIntent(context, intent));
}
```

`createDeviceServiceIntent` just copies the action and all extras onto a
new Intent targeting `SettingsDeviceService` (an `IntentService` in the
same `android.uid.system` process). Because the receiver is exported with
no permission, an unprivileged app can address it via *explicit* component
intent and bypass the intent-filter action constraint. The forwarded
extras are then consumed by `SettingsDeviceService.onHandleIntent`, which
dispatches on a `String event` extra to drive HMI navigation:

```
event = "UNPLUG"                       â†’ MEDIA_DEVICE_UNPLUGGED dialog
event = "PLUG"                         â†’ projection consent / hotspot prompt
event = "Connection fail"              â†’ DEVICE_CONNECTION_FAILED dialog
event = "WIRELESS_PROJECTION_DISABLED" â†’ projection-disabled dialog
event = "Disconnection success"        â†’ unplug toast
... and a handful of others
```

The service also accepts an attacker-controlled `DeviceInfo` Parcelable
(`"device Info"` extra) which carries the displayed device name, BT MAC,
and projection type into the dialogs. **The service does NOT call any
privileged write sink** â€” it only reads `Settings.Global.bt_auto_launch`
and triggers UI events on `aVar.i(...)`. So the impact is bounded to:

- Spamming arbitrary "Connection failed" / "Enable location required" /
  "Turn on hotspot" / "Device unplugged" dialogs at the user.
- Social-engineering the user into re-pairing a phone with a chosen
  display name and BT MAC (the values flow into the UI directly).

Severity: **Low.** No EOP. Real bug because the gate is misconfigured â€”
an unprivileged app should not be able to drive system HMI flows.

**Fix:** add `android:permission="..."` with at least `signature`
protection on the receiver, or set `android:exported="false"` and have
the actual sender of `gm.connection.DEVICE_CONNECTION_EVENT` (the
`DeviceConnectionManager`) deliver the broadcast via the implicit-target
path with a signature-protected permission.

#### Finding B â€” `com.gm.gmbugreport.service.ServiceControllerHelper.takeScreenShot` command injection

| | |
|---|---|
| APK | `com.gm.gmbugreport.service` |
| UID | `android.uid.system` |
| Permission gate | `com.gm.gmbugreport.permission.MANAGE_BUG_REPORTS` (`signatureOrSystem`) |
| Bug class | CWE-78 Command Injection |

In [`ServiceControllerHelper.takeScreenShot(String str)`](../recon_dump/apks/com_gm_gmbugreport_service/java_src/com/p002gm/gmbugreport/service/ServiceControllerHelper.java):

```java
file = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("/system/bin/screencap -p " + str + "/" + Utils.SCREENSHOT_NAME);
```

The `str` parameter is concatenated unescaped into a shell command line.
A caller controlling `str` can inject command separators:
`"; sh -c 'whatever' #"`.

The redeeming feature is the entire entrypoint chain is gated by
`MANAGE_BUG_REPORTS` at the **manifest layer** (protection level
`signatureOrSystem`). Only signature-or-system apps can invoke. So this is
a **defence-in-depth issue**, not directly exploitable from
`untrusted_app`. But: if a signature-gated app is ever shown to
mis-validate caller identity (the kind of bug Â§11.5.4 hunts for), this is
a fast root primitive.

**Fix:** swap `Runtime.exec(String)` for `ProcessBuilder(List<String>)`
which doesn't pass through a shell. Saves having to argue about
defence-in-depth.

#### Finding C â€” `com.gm.settings.receivers.AppsDispatcherReceiver` constrained Settings write

| | |
|---|---|
| APK | `com.gm.hmi.connection` |
| UID | `android.uid.system` |
| Permission gate | `com.gm.settings.permission.APPS_DISPATCHER` (declared in the same APK, protection level `0x3` = `signatureOrSystem`) |
| Bug class | CWE-20 Improper Input Validation (defence-in-depth) |

Receiver listens on `com.gm.server.appsdispatcherservice.intent.action.dispatch`,
unpacks an `intent.getParcelableExtra("CarProperty")` (Parcelable
constructable by any caller), and writes one of four named
`Settings.Global` entries:

```java
case 557850888: str = "wireless_charging_1_available"; break;
case 557850889: str = "wireless_charging_2_available"; break;
case 557850890: str = "wireless_charging_3_available"; break;
case 557850891: str = "wireless_charging_4_available"; break;
Settings.Global.putInt(contentResolver, str, carPropertyValue.getStatus());
```

Setting names are constrained to four hard-coded strings, so an attacker
cannot pivot this into writing `adb_enabled` or anything else useful.
The `status` int *is* attacker-controlled. The receiver is gated by
signature permission, so reachable only from sig-trusted apps. Like
Finding B: defence-in-depth issue. The receiver should at minimum verify
the `CarPropertyValue.getPropertyId()` was emitted by `CarPropertyManager`
itself (e.g. by binding to `CarService` and reading the live value), not
trust an attacker-supplied Parcelable.

### 11.4 Non-issues investigated and rejected

| Component | Why not exploitable |
|---|---|
| `com.android.car.CarService` | AOSP. Exported with no perm, but the Car Service API enforces per-method permission checks inside `CarServiceBase` and Binder transactions. |
| `com.android.car.settings.bluetooth.BluetoothPairingRequest` | Only acts on `android.bluetooth.device.action.PAIRING_REQUEST`, a `<protected-broadcast>`. Explicit-component dispatch lands in a path that requires a `BluetoothDevice` Parcelable obtained from BluetoothManager, which an untrusted app cannot mint. |
| `com.android.systemui.controls.management.ControlsRequestReceiver` | Verifies caller package is in foreground (`isPackageInForeground`). Working-as-intended Smart Home Controls UX. |
| `com.android.systemui.tuner.TunerActivity` | `Class.forName(preference.getFragment())` reads from a static XML preference resource, not intent extras. |
| `com.android.bluetooth.avrcpcontroller.AvrcpControllerService` | `SystemProperties.set` uses six hard-coded `AvrcpCoverArtManager.AVRCP_CONTROLLER_COVER_ART_*` keys; values come from AVRCP cover-art response parsing, not intent extras. |
| `com.gm.isaplugin.service.ISABroadcastReceiver` | Stores `media_mounted` extra in `ISAWrapper.updatePath` LiveData. Path is only consumed if the user manually navigates to `ISAPluginInstallingUpdateFragment` and taps "Install update". No drive-by trigger. |
| `com.gm.homescreen.app.UninstallPackageReceiver` | Reads `PACKAGE_NAME` and `STATUS_MESSAGE` extras from `PackageInstaller` callback intent â€” only logs them. No install/uninstall side effect. |

### 11.5 What we did *not* exhaustively audit

If a future round wants to push further, the remaining stones to turn over:

1. **ContentProvider entry points across the corpus.** Our scanner enumerates
   exported providers but doesn't model `query`/`update`/`delete`/`call`/
   `openFile` separately. A no-`readPermission`/`writePermission` provider
   that performs SQL `selection` string concatenation, file path traversal
   in `openFile`, or `call()` arbitrary-method dispatch is the classic
   Android attack vector. Suspect targets:
   `com.gm.server.carplay.service.internals.CarplayContentProvider`,
   `com.gm.server.gal.service.internals.GALMediaContentProvider`,
   `com.android.car.settings.qc.SettingsQCProvider`,
   `com.android.providers.settings.SettingsProvider` (the actual Settings
   backend â€” any GM-added URI?).
2. **Ultifi vehicle-bus AIDLs.** `com.gm.ultifi.service.bodyaccess` (doors/
   locks), `com.gm.ultifi.service.propulsion` (motor/torque),
   `com.gm.ultifi.service.lighting`, `com.gm.ultifi.service.chassis`, etc.
   Each runs as `ultifi.uid.core` and exposes AIDL methods. Several of
   their Service stanzas have **no `android:permission`**. Bind to them
   and enumerate transaction codes to see what they expose without
   authentication. (We caught `BodyAccessService` and
   `PowerManagementService` in Â§11.3's scanner under "shutdown" sinks but
   skipped because "shutdown" was a Service-lifecycle method match, not a
   privileged sink. Still: their AIDL surfaces are unexamined.)
3. **The 4 huge APKs we skipped** (sxm, vehicleinfo, gms, tipsandtour).
   Lower a-priori value but `com.gm.vehicleinfo` has the right name to
   matter for vehicle-data tampering.
4. **Caller-identity bypass in signature-gated entry points.** Finding B
   and C are gated by sig permissions today, but if any of those gates
   trusts a `Binder.getCallingUid()` value that an attacker can spoof
   (e.g. by impersonating a known sig-app UID via shared-user â€” won't
   work in practice â€” or by exploiting an unrelated sig-app that
   forwards on the attacker's behalf), the gate falls. Worth a
   per-component review of how each `enforceCallingPermission` is wired.
5. **`com.android.providers.settings`** â€” the actual SettingsProvider.
   AOSP enforces `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` on writes, but GM may have added
   URIs. The deep scanner flagged it for `reboot` sinks (false positives
   from `DeviceConfigService`/`SettingsProtoDumpUtil` dumps); a manual
   `query`/`call` audit would catch anything GM-added.

### 11.6 Verdict

The audit did not surface a path to ADB or to writing privileged
settings. Three real but low-severity weaknesses were identified, all
worth reporting to GM as security hardening:

- **A**: missing permission on `DeviceConnectionEventReceiver` â†’
  UI spoofing.
- **B**: shell-string concatenation in `takeScreenShot` â†’ command
  injection (defence-in-depth, behind sig-gate).
- **C**: weak input validation in `AppsDispatcherReceiver` â†’
  trust-boundary issue (defence-in-depth, behind sig-gate).

The scanners produced in Â§11.1 are committed and reusable. They are
the right tool to run against future AAOS firmware drops to confirm GM
has fixed these or to surface new ones.

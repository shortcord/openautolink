# OpenAutoLink — Local Testing Guide

## Overview

Full end-to-end testing requires the AAOS app talking to the bridge over a real network. Since the GM head unit has **no ADB access** due to GM restrictions, we use the Android SDK AAOS emulator as a stand-in. The bridge runs on a physical SBC connected to the development PC via two separate network cables.

## Prerequisites

- Android SDK with emulator and platform-tools installed
- AAOS emulator AVD: **`BlazerEV_AAOS`** (Android 33 Automotive, x86_64, 2400×960 landscape)
- SBC with bridge built and running (see [bridge/sbc/BUILD.md](../bridge/sbc/BUILD.md))
- Two ethernet cables
- One USB ethernet adapter (for the SBC's SSH connection)
- A phone with Android Auto for full end-to-end tests

## 1. Hardware Setup

### Two-Cable Network Connection

The SBC requires **two separate network connections** to your PC:

| Cable | SBC Side | PC Side | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Cable 1 — Bridge traffic** | **Onboard NIC** (eth0, RJ45 on the board) | Dedicated NIC or USB ethernet adapter on PC | OAL protocol (control/video/audio) |
| **Cable 2 — SSH** | **USB NIC** (USB ethernet adapter plugged into SBC) | Any available NIC on PC | SSH access for development |

> **Why two cables?** The onboard NIC is locked to the car network subnet (192.168.222.0/24) with a static IP. Mixing SSH and bridge traffic on one interface creates routing conflicts and doesn't match the real car topology.

### SSH Connection via WiFi Sharing

The simplest way to give the SBC an SSH-accessible IP from your dev PC:

1. **Share your PC's WiFi to the SSH NIC** — In Windows: Settings → Network → Wi-Fi → Properties → "Share this connection" → select the NIC connected to the SBC's USB ethernet adapter
2. Windows ICS (Internet Connection Sharing) runs a DHCP server on that NIC in the **`192.168.137.0/24`** subnet (the PC becomes `192.168.137.1`)
3. The SBC's USB NIC gets a DHCP lease (e.g. `192.168.137.x`)
4. **Discover the SBC's IP via ARP:**
   ```powershell
   # After the SBC boots and gets a DHCP lease:
   arp -a | Select-String "192.168.137"
   ```
5. SSH in: `ssh khadas@192.168.137.x` (substitute your SBC's username and discovered IP)

> **Tip:** The SBC's MAC address won't change, so Windows ICS will usually assign the same IP across reboots. Note it down after first discovery.

### IP Addressing

This mirrors the real car environment:

| Device | IP | Role |
|--------|-----|------|
| SBC onboard NIC (eth0) | `192.168.222.222` | Bridge — already configured by `setup-car-net.sh` |
| Emulator (acting as head unit) | `192.168.222.108` | App — matches the IP the GM head unit assigns to its USB NIC |
| SBC USB NIC (eth1+) | DHCP from Windows ICS | SSH management — `192.168.137.x` subnet |
| PC SSH NIC | `192.168.137.1` | SSH client access (Windows ICS gateway) |

## 2. SBC Initial Setup (First Time Only)

Before the bridge can be built and deployed, the SBC needs a one-time setup for key-based SSH and passwordless sudo so that development tools (including Copilot) can work freely on the SBC.

### 2a. OS Setup

1. Flash the SBC's OS image per its manufacturer's instructions
2. Boot the SBC and connect via SSH (password auth initially): `ssh <user>@<sbc-ip>`
3. Update the OS:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

### 2b. Key-Based SSH

Generate an SSH key on your dev PC (if you don't have one) and copy it to the SBC:

```powershell
# On the dev PC (PowerShell)
# Generate key if needed:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "openautolink-dev"

# Copy public key to SBC (will prompt for password one last time):
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | ssh <user>@<sbc-ip> "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Verify: `ssh <user>@<sbc-ip>` should now connect without a password prompt.

### 2c. Passwordless Sudo

On the SBC, add a sudoers rule so the dev user can run commands without a password:

```bash
# On the SBC:
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/dev-nopasswd
# Add this line (replace <user> with your SBC username):
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Verify: `sudo whoami` should return `root` without a password prompt.

> **Why passwordless sudo?** Copilot and deployment scripts (`scp`, `ssh` commands in `deploy-to-sbc.ps1`) need to restart services, install files to `/opt/openautolink/`, and run `systemctl` without interactive prompts.

### 2d. Verify

```powershell
# From the dev PC — should work with no prompts:
ssh <user>@<sbc-ip> "sudo systemctl status sshd"
```

Once complete, proceed to build and deploy the bridge per [bridge/sbc/BUILD.md](../bridge/sbc/BUILD.md).

## 3. Emulator Setup

### Starting the Emulator

```powershell
# From Android SDK (typical path)
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\emulator\emulator.exe" -avd BlazerEV_AAOS
```

Or launch from Android Studio → Device Manager → `BlazerEV_AAOS`.

### Configuring the Emulator's Network for Bridge Traffic

The emulator must be reachable at `192.168.222.108` on the bridge network — this is the IP the GM head unit always assigns when a USB NIC is plugged in. Configuring the emulator this way ensures the app behaves identically to the real car.

#### Option A: Host-Side Port Forwarding (Simplest)

Use `adb` to forward the emulator's ports through the host PC's bridge NIC:

```powershell
# Forward bridge ports from PC (192.168.222.108) to emulator
# Run these after the emulator is booted

# On the PC NIC connected to the SBC, set a secondary IP:
# (Control Panel → Network Adapter → Properties → IPv4 → Advanced → Add 192.168.222.108)
# Or via PowerShell (run as Administrator):
New-NetIPAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet 2" -IPAddress 192.168.222.108 -PrefixLength 24

# Forward ports from PC to emulator
adb forward tcp:5288 tcp:5288
adb forward tcp:5289 tcp:5289
adb forward tcp:5290 tcp:5290
```

> **Note:** Replace `"Ethernet 2"` with the name of your PC NIC connected to the SBC's onboard NIC. Run `Get-NetAdapter` to list adapters.

With this approach, the bridge connects to `192.168.222.108:5288/5289/5290` and the traffic is forwarded into the emulator.

#### Option B: Reverse ADB (App Connects Outbound)

Since the app initiates the TCP connections (app → bridge), you can use `adb reverse` to let the emulator reach the SBC:

```powershell
# Make the emulator see 192.168.222.222:5288 as localhost:5288
adb reverse tcp:5288 tcp:5288
adb reverse tcp:5289 tcp:5289
adb reverse tcp:5290 tcp:5290
```

Then configure the app to connect to `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) as the bridge address. The traffic will route through the host to the SBC at `192.168.222.222`.

> **Recommended:** Option B is the most reliable for the app's connection model (app connects to bridge). Set the bridge IP in the app's settings to `127.0.0.1` and use `adb reverse` to tunnel.

## 4. Installing and Running the App

### Build and Install

```powershell
# Build debug APK
.\gradlew :app:assembleDebug

# Install to running emulator
adb install -r app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

### Launch the App

```powershell
adb shell am start -n com.openautolink.app/.ui.MainActivity
```

### View Logs

```powershell
# All app logs
adb logcat --pid=$(adb shell pidof com.openautolink.app)

# Filter for OpenAutoLink tags
adb logcat -s OAL:* Transport:* Video:* Audio:*
```

## 5. Bridge Setup (SBC Side)

### Verify Car Network

SSH into the SBC via the USB NIC connection:

```bash
# Check the onboard NIC has the correct IP
ip addr show eth0
# Should show 192.168.222.222/24

# Verify the bridge service is running
sudo systemctl status openautolink.service

# Check bridge logs
sudo journalctl -u openautolink.service -f
```

### Verify Network Connectivity

From the SBC, confirm the emulator (or its host) is reachable:

```bash
ping -c 3 192.168.222.108
```

From the PC, confirm the bridge is reachable:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 192.168.222.222 -Port 5288
```

## 6. End-to-End Test Workflow

1. **Boot SBC** — bridge starts automatically via systemd
2. **SSH into SBC** — verify `eth0` is `192.168.222.222`, bridge is running
3. **Start emulator** — launch `BlazerEV_AAOS`
4. **Configure networking** — set up port forwarding or `adb reverse` (see Section 2)
5. **Install app** — `adb install` the debug APK
6. **Launch app** — app should show "Connecting..." and attempt to reach the bridge
7. **Pair phone** — use Bluetooth on the SBC to pair with a phone running Android Auto
8. **Verify projection** — video should render in the emulator, audio should play, touch should respond

### What to Verify

| Component | How to Test | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **TCP connection** | App status UI / logcat | Three channels connect (control, video, audio) |
| **Video** | Emulator display | Phone screen projected, smooth rendering |
| **Audio** | Emulator audio output | Media/nav audio plays through correct purposes |
| **Touch** | Click/drag in emulator | Touch events forwarded to phone, UI responds |
| **Reconnection** | Kill bridge, restart | App shows "Connecting...", reconnects when bridge returns |
| **Settings** | App settings screen | Bridge IP, codec preferences persisted via DataStore |

## 7. Unit and Integration Tests

These run without hardware:

```powershell
# Unit tests (no emulator needed)
.\gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest

# Instrumentation tests (requires running emulator)
.\gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

## 8. Testing in the Real Car

In-car testing is harder than emulator testing but critical at key milestones — it's the only way to validate real hardware decoders, audio routing, VHAL integration, and actual reconnection behavior.

### What's Different

- **No ADB access** — GM locks down ADB on production head units. No `logcat`, no `adb install`, no `adb reverse`
- **No debug APKs** — the app must be built as a **signed AAB** (Android App Bundle) and uploaded to the **Google Play Console internal/closed testing track** for every new build
- **No live debugging** — rely on the app's built-in diagnostics screen for status and error info
- **Bridge SSH still works** — the second USB NIC cable from your laptop to the SBC provides SSH access, same as in emulator testing. You can still deploy bridge updates, view logs, and restart services from your laptop while sitting in the car

### Deploying a Test Build

```powershell
# 1. Build signed AAB
.\gradlew :app:bundleRelease

# 2. Upload to Play Console
#    Play Console → OpenAutoLink → Testing → Internal testing → Create new release
#    Upload: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
#    Roll out to internal testers

# 3. On the head unit: open Play Store → update the app
#    (or wait for auto-update if already installed)
```

> **Turnaround time:** Play Console internal testing typically processes builds in minutes, but there's no instant deploy path. Plan testing sessions accordingly.

### Bridge Access While In-Car

SSH into the SBC from your laptop the same way as on the bench — share WiFi to your USB NIC, discover the SBC via ARP, and connect:

```powershell
arp -a | Select-String "192.168.137"
ssh khadas@192.168.137.x
# View bridge logs live:
sudo journalctl -u openautolink.service -f
```

### What to Test In-Car (vs Emulator)

| Area | Why in-car matters |
|------|-------------------|
| **Hardware video decoding** | Real Qualcomm C2 decoders behave differently than emulator software decoders |
| **Audio routing** | Car audio system, steering wheel controls, multi-zone output |
| **Reconnection** | Real power cycle — ignition off/on, SBC cold boot |
| **Touch calibration** | Real touchscreen DPI, coordinate mapping on 2914×1134 display |
| **VHAL data** | Real vehicle speed, gear, parking state |
| **Network stability** | Real USB gadget/NIC behavior on the car's USB port |

This is why emulator testing handles the bulk of development — it's the only environment with full `adb` access for rapid iteration. In-car testing validates what the emulator can't.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Emulator can't reach `192.168.222.222` | Port forwarding / reverse not set up | Run `adb reverse` commands (Section 3, Option B) |
| Bridge can't reach `192.168.222.108` | PC NIC missing secondary IP | Add `192.168.222.108` to the PC NIC on the bridge subnet |
| App shows "Connecting..." forever | Bridge not running or wrong IP in app | Check `systemctl status openautolink.service`; verify app bridge IP setting |
| Video renders but no audio | Audio purpose routing mismatch | Check logcat for AudioTrack errors; see [embedded-knowledge.md](embedded-knowledge.md) |
| Emulator is slow / video stutters | x86_64 emulated decoder limitations | Expected — emulator hardware decoding is weaker than the real head unit |
| SSH connection drops | SBC USB NIC lost / wrong cable | Verify USB NIC is `eth1+` not `eth0`; check `setup-eth-ssh.sh` logs |
